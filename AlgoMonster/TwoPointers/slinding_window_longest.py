"""sliding window â€“ longest

given a string s and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

parameters

s: a string

k: an integer

result

an integer representing the length of the longest substring with at most k distinct characters.

examples

input:

s = "eceba", k = 2


output:

3


explanation: the substring "ece" has 2 distinct characters and is the longest.

input:

s = "aa", k = 1


output:

2


explanation: the substring "aa" has 1 distinct character and is the longest.

constraints

1 <= len(s) <= 10^5

s consists of lowercase letters only

1 <= k <= 26
